# Demo Admin

This is a project to build a barebones admin dashboard template.
The goal is to have a simplified responsive layout that allows Developers to rapidly customize and keep as their own.

The Dashboard will consist of:
- Fully responsive panels
- Color themes
- Font themes
- drop-in components, as well as
- HTTP Repository & Data Access Layer for scalable communication between your UI and the outside world

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
pnpm create svelte@latest .

# create a new project in the directory "my-app"
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
